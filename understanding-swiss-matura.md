## What is the Swiss Matura?

The Swiss Matura (or Maturit√©) is the federal maturity certificate awarded upon completion of upper secondary education in Switzerland. It is recognized internationally and provides automatic access to all Swiss public universities, including EPFL and ETH Zurich.

### Structure of the Matura

The Matura is a two-year program following lower secondary education. It includes:

- Compulsory subjects: Mathematics, native language, second national language, foreign language
- Elective subjects in humanities, sciences, or arts
- Matura thesis (extended essay)
- Oral and written examinations

### Assessment Methods

The Matura combines school-based coursework (30%) with centralized final exams (70%). This balanced approach ensures both consistent academic performance and excellence in final assessments.

### University Access

One of the key advantages of the Swiss Matura is automatic access to all Swiss public universities. Unlike international qualifications that require additional documentation and review, Matura graduates have a direct pathway to higher education in Switzerland.
